                    <p id="bigDef1">
                        FSE150 is an unconventional class, to say the least. It is a class that is not just about
                        learning but about exploring and understanding the world around us through a lens of innovative
                        engineering. It is a class that is not just about the technical aspects of engineering but about
                        the PESTLE approach to problem-solving. Taking this class early enough in my academic journey
                        certainly has its positive implications, and I aim to reflect upon them in this article. My GCSP
                        Theme is Security for a variety of reasons that you can find by clicking <a
                            href="./gcsp.html">here</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p id="bigDef">
                        For years, I thought improving security meant adding more layers of encryption or firewalls.
                        However, this class has taught me that security is not just about the digital aspects but about
                        the human aspects as well. It is about understanding taking away the burden of stress and
                        anxiety from people. It is about making people feel safe and secure in their own environment. To
                        better explain, I wish to bring up my theme project (which you can find below). To summarize, it
                        assessed the implementation of Artificial Intelligence to safeguard social media for children.
                        From my experience, I can certainly confirm that I frequently receive spam messages or
                        inappropriate content in my personal space. Therefore, this project uses emerging technologies
                        like LLM-Powered Sentiment Analysis and CNN-based image identification to filter out such
                        content. With the perspective I gained in this course, I was able to evaluate this project from
                        critical human perspectives rather than a unidimensional perspective on security. Not only does
                        this empower digital safety, but also emotional safety by preventing exposure to indecent
                        content. This also benefits human moderators, who otherwise have to go through traumatic content
                        in order to filter it out. It also improves social safety by addressing threats like aggression,
                        devaluation, and discrimination. </p>

                        Beyond security and my other existing interests, this course served as a powerful platform to
                        delve into the intricacies of themes like Sustainability, Health, and Joy of Living. One notable
                        class activity would be life-cycle analysis, where we analyzed the impact of chicken nuggets.
                        This activity was particularly eye-opening as it made me realize the impact of every single
                        bit of engineering on sustainability. It made me realize that problem-solving is not just about
                        creating new products but about creating products but also ensuring they are financially,
                        environmentally, and socially sustainable. I'm also grateful for meeting a diverse group of
                        guest speakers who shared their experiences and insights on the use of engineering in their
                        fields. Heather Clark, the director of School of Biological and Health Systems Engineering,
                        delivered a compelling lecture about using nanotechnology to improve medicine delivery. Her
                        presentation made me keen on understanding how research in the fields of computing addresses
                        real-world needs in her lab, which resulted in me attending her lab meetings to gain some
                        crucial perspective on how the world of academia is affected by advancements in Artificial
                        Intelligence. These new interests and perspectives are going to play a crucial role since I will
                        be able to anchor my future research to cater real-world needs.

                        The assignments in this class were equally unique. My favorite being meeting with a faculty at
                        our university to discuss about their research and future projects. This not only gives us
                        awareness on the advancements being pursued by ASU, but also gives us an idea of the skills and
                        pre-requisites to be gained before contributing to such endeavors. I met up with Dr. Huan Liu
                        (founder of the Data Mining and Machine Learning Lab, which can be found below) and his PhD
                        student, Amritha Bhattacharjee. These meetings gave me a lot of information on future
                        opportunities in the fields of emerging technology. Producing textual descriptions of content
                        requires human-intensive effort even when we have powerful text-models like ChatGPT. Therefore,
                        we drafted a project proposal to investigate the use of LLMs in the feature extraction and
                        selection phase of data analysis workflows. This brings to my future with GCSP and my academic journey overall. I have gained insights into the interdisciplinary nature of engineering, understanding that solutions to complex problems often require perspectives from various fields beyond software. This awareness will enable me to design solutions that are culturally sensitive and relevant to a global audience. It has also inculcated a service-oriented mindset that will encourage me to pursue projects with a positive impact on communities. The lessons are certainly crucial to my professional development and are helping me to cultivate talents aligned with my interests and goals. Overall, this course empowers me to approach engineering challenges with a more comprehensive understanding, a global mindset, and a commitment to serving the greater good!
